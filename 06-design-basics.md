# Design Basics

Welcome to design.  The first thing I'd like to say is that, **DESIGN IS SUBJECTIVE**.  

What looks beautiful to you could look ugly to someone else, and vice versa.  We all have our own tastes and preferences.   It's the same as when you want to date someone, or when you decide to eat something.  

Unfortunately, we need to make designs that appeal to the boss (or client) -- and by the way, sometimes the client is YOU (especially if you are starting out).  So how do we get the design right?  Let's follow a couple principles below:

## The Basics

### Always have a layout

Your layout is your savior.  It's a lot easier to draw something in 15 minutes with a pen and paper, or even assemble together a quick HTML skeleton page than it is to draw a beautiful website in Photoshop or Illustrator; then have to go reassemble it because the client hated it.   

### Have 3-5 References of Other Designs the Client Likes

Before you start working on the design, you need to know what the client likes.  Ask them directly what they like, and for 3-5 examples.  If you are your own client, go find 3-5 websites you like that represent the type of design you would like to make.   

### Study The Trends

You can also study trends for the industry you are interested in working in.  If you want to work in fashion, study all the fashion websites out there and find out which websites do it the best.  This might feel overwhelming, but your job today isn't to become the top website in fashion.  All you need to do is learn a few things you can take back to your own design.  **Through practice and more studying, you can make your future designs incrementally better.**

Also check out design ideas on sites like [Pinterest.com](https://pinterest.com), [Instagram.com](https://instagram.com) and [Themeforest](https://themeforest.net/).  In addition, there are a lot of tutorials offered by companies like [Adobe](https://adobe.com), [Canva](https://canva.com) and [Figma](https://figma.com) who can give you even more ideas for inspiration.  I'm constantly checking out new tutorials offered by these companies, given that they are free!

### Use Your Favorite Tool To Design

If you are a Photoshop person, use Photoshop.  If you are an Illustrator person, use Illustrator.  There's also other apps like Canva, Sketch, Adobe XD, and so on.  If you don't know any of the tools, pick one and start learning!  You can also explore any of these tools early on by just checking out video tutorials on sites like YouTube, so you get a sense of how they work.

Ultimately though, the tool really doesn't matter, so long as you can create a nice design.

### Examine Your Sources in Great Detail

Since there's a lot that goes into studying, I'm going to provide you with a checklist of things I do when I study new designs:

- What are the primary colors? 
  - Usually there are 2 main colors, and 2 secondary colors
  - The easiest way to figure out which is the primary color is to look at how often colors repeat
  - If you see green the most amount of times in the site, that is the primary color
  - Secondary colors are less frequent, but appear either to contrast or complement a primary color
  - If you notice white with green a lot, then green and white are complementary colors
  - If you see greens and purples, these are contrasting colors (because they are really different)

- What is the layout?
  - What kind of site is this?  Is it a blog? A newsite? A shopping site? An ad?
  - Are there a lot of images, or is the site text heavy?
  - Are there separations between content?
  - Does content get bigger or smaller as you scroll the page?
  - How many columns on the webpage?  How about rows?
  - How are sections organized? 
  - What are the primary headings of the page?  How about sub-headings?
  - Are there any links on the page? How are they presented?
  - Are there graphs, charts, lists on the page?  How are they presented?
  - If you were to get a ruler (you can use a pixel ruler extension), could you figure out how much space is between each section?  How about space between elements?
  - Is the site crowded with a lot of content or is it minimalistic (e.g. Zen Garden)
  - Do buttons on the site have sharp or rounded corners?
  - What does the site look like if you resize the page to something smaller? 

- What is the Typography?
  - Are fonts really light or are they very strong (bold)?
  - Are there degrees of variation between fonts that are light and fonts that are strong?
  - Are the fonts soft, meaning do they curve, or are they harsh with sharp edges?
  - What are the names of the fonts? 
  - Can you find similar fonts on [Google Fonts](https://googlefonts.com)? [DaFont.com](https://www.dafont.com/)?

- What Things Jump Out?
  - Is there a lot of animation?
  - Is there a twist on anything? E.g colors inverted, layout using non-conventional shapes?
  - Does the website collect information?  What is the process flow?
  - Are there popups on the site? Chat boxes?
  - Is the site video heavy?  Photo heavy?  Do photos slide in and out?
  - Is there a background video?
  - Do sections show and hide?  Do new sections appear when you scroll down the page?
  - Do things change based on your interaction with the site?  How so?
  - Is the site tracking you?  How so?

#### Inspect With Browser Tools

**NOTE:** You'll want to use a tool in your browser called an Inspector, which comes with just about every browser.  If you use Google Chrome, you can use the Inspector tool by right clicking anywhere on a webpage and selecting `Inspect`.  (If this option is not available, you may need to enable it in your Browser Preferences -- e.g. Safari requires you to enable the Developer tab first before you can start using the inspector).   

Upon opening the inspector, you should see an HTML layout of the entire webpage you are looking at, which might be overwhelming!  Don't worry, we will go through every aspect of the Inspector with time!  For now, it's best to just keep yourself occupied with the main `Elements` tab.   To the left of the `Elements` tab you will see two icons, one that looks like an arrow selecting a box, and another that looks like a mobile phone/tablet icon.  Select the first icon with the arrow in a box.  

Now go over any part of the webpage and click to instantly see what the HTML for that selection.  For example, if you select an image, you'll see how it was coded in HTML with this tool.  Handy!  If you click the mobile/tablet icon instead, you'll see how the page looks if it were viewed on a phone / tablet (which you can control in the settings).  To return back, just click the phone/tablet icon again to get to "Desktop Mode".

You will also notice to the right of the HTML layout is a column that primarily shows Style information.   As a preview, this is CSS that we are going to be working with to add to our HTML to make the code we write more beautiful.   The important thing to do while inspecting is just look at these properties in the style area, and look for items of interest like colors, fonts, spacing.  Even if you don't completely understand, use this tool to just help you get some of the gist of what's going on in the page.

### Find Patterns and Commonalities

After studying many of the different pages, write down what you see again and again across all the references.  Make note of it.  There's SO MUCH studying you really could do, but eventually you want to boil everything down to a few simple things you can work with.

For example, if you see all the pages the client sent you were "dark" themed, it's safe to say that your client likes a dark color scheme.

If you notice that the webpages are all following the same row/column "grid" structure, then you can also use that same row/column layout for the work you do.

Keep working through all the patterns and commonalities you find, and keeping note of anything that contrasts what you've learned.  For example, if one site is REALLY different from the other sites, ask your client (even if client is yourself) what they like about that site.   

### Don't Copy But Do Imitate To Learn

When you start designing, you are often just going to be trying to copy what you see on other sites.  That's totally fine.  In fact, it's really okay to just copy and try to rebuild a lot of cool designs you see out there; just to know if you can do it yourself.

What you shouldn't do is COPY a website entirely and then pass it off as your own work.  That's a huge NO-NO.  The only reason to imitate is to learn something new.  Once you figure out how to create something cool, try to add your own creative twist to it.  

Many artists will say that they are original, but the truth is -- no one is original.  Everyone is copying someone else, even all the way up to some of the greatest performers of all time.  Michael Jackson imitated James Brown and Smokey Robinson as a young child, then was heavily inspired by Fred Astaire for dance moves.  Yet he added his own twists on moves after learning from the masters.  Johnny Ive was inspired heavily by 50s futuristic designs before he made the iPhone.   Nobou Uematsu was a huge fan of rock and roll, and used many elements of [beats he heard in his Final Fantasy soundtracks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ITGMYWhfMs). 

So you see, you can be an artist too if you practice and dial in enough to what's interesting out there.  It's fun as a hobby and if you put in the effort, today you might not be that great, but if you practice as often as you can, year over year you will get better!  You might even become famous!
