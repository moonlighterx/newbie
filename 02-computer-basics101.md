# Computer Basics 101

Before we jump into programming, I feel like we need to have a section on Computer Basics.  For those of you familiar with the material (you can skim ahead to check), feel free to skip on to the next section.

However, every time I teach this course, I always meet people completely unfamiliar with how to make files and folders, as well as how to find apps on their computer.   If that's you, stay with me for this lesson, I want to make sure you are covered.

## What Are Files?

You use a computer to store information.  Fundamentally, this is why we even have computers in the first place.  There are too many things we all have to remember, keep track of, analyze, the list goes on.  A computer gives you a way to save information into specific file formats you can then retrieve later -- quickly.   We use software (aka apps) to open files for viewing and/or editing.  

For example, many people take photos and videos on a camera or cellphone and then view them later on a computer in one of the following formats: `jpeg`, `png`, `jpg`, `mov`, `wmv`, `mp4` on software like Adobe Photoshop or Quicktime.  Technically any of these photos or videos are bits of information stored to the computer as files.  Usually a file is saved as something like `MY_MOVIE.mp4` or `MY_IMAGE.jpg`.  The convention is `<filename>.<extension>`.  So you would name the `filename`, and the `.extension` would indicate what kind of file format it was.  

Sometimes you need to save the file with an extension type, other times your computer does it for you.  **When in doubt, save the file with an extension, so you know exactly what kind of file it is.**

If you are saving an image to your computer, it makes sense to save it as a `jpg` or `png` file, and not a `mov` or `mp4` file -- as those extensions are for video.   If you aren't sure, you can always research online what any extension means with your favorite search engine.

## What Are Folders?

Folders hold many files.  People will often organize photos and videos into folders, like `Summer Vacation 2020` or `Exotic Birds From India`.   

Files are not just photos and videos.  There are also files like spreadsheets, word documents, presentation slides, PDFs, and countless other formats.  Again, based on file type, most people will organize into an appropriate folder.

Some people lose track of where files and folders are on their computer.  If you're like my dad, you might end up saving everything to your Desktop.  When you go to look at your Desktop later, it's just crowded with folders and files, making it very hard to look at it.  

Other people put everything into a default folder, and have a hard time relocating the file after saving it.  Still, other people save files onto USB drives, CDs, other hard drives, or even on Dropboxes outside of their computer and run into a lot of trouble trying to locate the file later.

## Let's BE ORGANIZED

If you want to be good with computers, YOU MUST ORGANIZE your files and folders.

The easiest way to do this is to pick a folder you can get to easily, and then put every other folder and file into that folder.   This folder will always be your starting point or "home folder" for every project you work on.   Inside this folder, you can create other new folders and files, but you will need to continue to organize and keep track of where everything is going.

Think of folder organization as like organizing your home.  You have places you put everything in, e.g. your house holds everything, but your kitchen holds all your utensils and food, while your bathroom holds all your bathroom items, and your living room holds all your sofas, TVs, games, books, and your bedroom has your bed.   You would never put everything in your bathroom.

Going back to our "home" folder, you want to create some kind of organization where your photos and videos go into some kind of "Media" folder, while your important spreadsheets and office work go into a "Documents folder", and your programming work goes in a "Programming" folder.   Lucky for you, Mac/Windows/Linux all give you some organization out of the box, which you can follow without having to recreate the wheel.

For example, if you are on Windows, you can click Start and open up Windows Explorer to see your default hard drives, like `C: Drive`.   If you click on this drive, you'll see a lot of folders, including one called `User` or `Users`.   Clicking on that folder will take you to a folder with your name on it, so `C:\Users\jeffy`, and from there you'll see folders inside like `Documents`, `Photos`, `Downloads`, `Desktop` and more.  

If you're on Mac or Linux, it would be the same process -- you would use the Dock or Start Bar to navigate to Finder, click on your Hard Drive, then find your `Users` folder, then a folder with your name on it `jeffy` and then look for folders like `Downloads`, `Desktop`, `Movies`, `Music` and so on.

In most cases, you probably won't even need to do this many steps -- as by default if you open up Windows Explorer or Finder, you'll automatically be taken to your home folder.

You don't have to use your home folder as the default folder if you don't want to.  You can make your own folder somewhere else, but this could be more difficult for you to find later, as well as take more steps to accomplish.  So it makes sense to just work out of the default Home folder that Mac/Windows/Linux gives you. 

For our purposes, we will want to make a new folder inside our `Home` folder called `Programming`.  Please do that now.  It's as easy as right clicking and selecting `New Folder` and then typing in the name.

From here on out, whatever code examples we work on, please save them to the `Programming` folder.  Until you are ready, do not save any coding projects in a folder anywhere else on your computer, especially `Desktop`.  Though this could be easier to access for you, we want to stay organized.

## By The Way, Where's The Applications Folder? (Programs on Windows)

### Can you locate a folder called Applications (if you are on Mac/Linux), or a folder called Programs if you are on Windows?  

Normally this folder is outside your Home folder.   To get to it you will need to navigate outside your Home folder, as well as outside your Users folder, and return to your "Hard Drive" folder, often called root drive or `C:` drive.   From here, you need to look for your `Programs` or `Applications` folder.

You might be wondering why your `Programs` / `Applications` live outside your `Home` folder.  You might also be tempted to move them to your new Home folder to stay organized.  **DON'T DO THIS.**

Windows, Mac and Linux keep your software in these special folders so that other programs that need them can find them as well.  By breaking the default organization that comes with your computer, you will make it harder for your computer to find files it needs to run properly.   

In fact, breaking organization outside your Home folder was the number one reason for years people had their computers crash.  Computer viruses often re-organize or even delete important files and folders on your computer that result in your computer no longer operating correctly.  In recent years, there are way more protections in place to prevent computers from breaking but the short and long is don't mess with software in your `Applications` / `Programs` folder. 

Be aware of what you are downloading to your computer as well, if you browse the Internet often and are prompted to download files or folders that you've never heard about -- be extremely careful, it could be a virus.   Some websites may even prompt you that you need to install software to view the website, or that your computer is running slow and you need to install software to fix it.  Don't do this ever, and only download software from places you trust like the Apple App Store, Windows Store or have researched and verified as legit software through search engine results.  Websites don't need extra software in this day and age to be viewable as we will learn.   

**TL:DR**, All you need to know is how to find a particular app in those folders and open it.  For example if I said, find Google Chrome, the goal would be that you could locate it easily, open it and not break anything else in the process.  

### ProTip

Over the years, Microsoft, Apple, Linux have made it easier to find your Applications/Programs folders.  You most likely know you can use the Start Bar on Windows to find any Program quickly, but with Windows 10 you can just [type into the Search Bar](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17190/windows-10-search-for-anything) whatever program you are looking for.   With MacOS you can use [Spotlight](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204014) to help you find a program fast.  Linux also has similar features which you can add in through a package manager, so if you are missing it, search online for directions on how to enable the features.  

As long as you can find your files, folders and applications fast -- you are in good shape for the rest of this course. Be sure you are extremely comfortable with the basics of files and folders.  In the next few chapters, we will learn about programming file types especially the `.html`, `.css` and `.js` file types you will use to code webpages.  Stay tuned!


## One More Thing

As you start using your computer to do more work, you will notably have more apps open.  Apps (software) all consume computer resources like CPU, Hard Drive Space and Memory (RAM). CPU controls how fast the computer can run tasks, while Hard Drive Space is the space a program might take up on your computer when installed or saving new files (usually in megabytes or gigabytes, sometimes even terabytes).   RAM is the amount of space a program might take up on your computer WHILE ACTIVE.  

So if you open up a program and let it run, it's actively consuming your computer's RAM.  Let's assume you have a browser like Google Chrome open.  Because it's open, it's consuming your computer's RAM actively.  The more Google Chrome tabs you open, the more RAM that is consumed.  Eventually your computer runs out of RAM, and so it begins to consume other resources like Hard Drive space to make up for RAM deficiency; making your computer slower.   On top of this, if you have other applications like iTunes or Adobe Photoshop open, then your computer could run out of memory even faster.  

The best thing to do is to quit applications you don't need.  Simply close the program on Windows, if you are on a Mac, right click on any open Application and select Quit Application (closing doesn't actually close the program).  By making sure you close the program, RAM is freed up and your computer can run faster again.  If you are using Google Chrome and have multiple tabs open, quit some of the tabs by closing them.  

If you ever feel your computer is running slow, you can use a program called [Windows Task Manager](https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2938-open-task-manager-windows-10-a.html), or Mac/Linux ([Activity Monitor](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201464)) to see which programs are consuming a lot of RAM, CPU.  Usually this information is shown in easy to understand graphs and percentages, so if some program is really slowing down your computer and you see that in the Activity Monitor or Task Manager, quit the program!  Save your computer's resources!
