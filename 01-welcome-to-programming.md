# Welcome to Programming

Welcome to programming 101!  I'm going to assume a couple things here.  

1.  You've never coded before (or have very limited exposure)
2.  You are interested in learning programming either as a new skill or for career prospects.

If neither of these apply to, feel free to write to me why you are deciding to learn programming.  I'd love to hear from you.

So let's dive in!

## Why Programming?

Programming is all about optimization.  In simpler terms, it's about doing less work.

For example, if you work or go to school you have a series of things to do each day.  Some of these things to do (we'll call them tasks) take more time than other tasks.

If you aren't careful, these tasks could consume all the time you have in a day, and you end up having to add tasks from today to being tasks to pile on to tomorrow's workload.   

For example here's my typical day.

- Get up, brush teeth
- Make breakfast
- (drive to work -- during covid19 can just be remote)
- At work, log into my computer, start working
- Read emails from work colleagues, prioritize workday based on urgency of email
- Work on any high level projects or urgent projects first
- 30 min jog at gym, then 15 min lunch, 15 min for drive time to and from
- Attend to emails from colleagues, fix in order of urgency.
- Continue working on high level projects
- Check in with boss, colleagues, discuss projects
- Finish up any work, or put on to tomorrow's workload
- Do any errands (post office, pay bills, call anyone back who called me in day)
- (drive to home)
- Make dinner
- Play with kids
- Study, work on business, learn programming
- Go to sleep

If any of these tasks take me longer than usual to finish, it could make the rest of the tasks due that day get pushed on to the next day -- which may get pushed to the next day and so on.   If I'm late to work because of traffic, I end up having less time to work, which could make me have to cut into my own personal tasks like gym, lunch or paying bills -- since work takes priority.  Don't want to get fired, right?

So, if I could add some efficiency to my work day, it could help me get through all the tasks I need to do quickly and still have time for myself thereafter.  If I finish all my tasks daily and have left over time, I could even do tasks for tomorrow, reducing my workload further, and so on -- to the point where I might even have a day where I have only a few hours of work, aka an easy day.  For me that's usually "Friday".  I love easy Fridays, because if I get all my work done, it really does feel like a "free day". 

## How Do We Optimize?

Optimizing is about going through each task and evaluating whether the task could be done better or if we even need the task at all.

Let's filter my list from above to show tasks that I might NOT need to do daily:

- Make breakfast
- (drive to work)
- Read emails from work colleagues, prioritize workday based on urgency of email
- Attend to emails from colleagues, fix in order of urgency.
- Check in with boss, colleagues, discuss projects
- Do any errands (post office, pay bills, call anyone back who called me in day)
- (drive to home)
- Make dinner

I don't need to make breakfast, lunch and dinner daily.  I could instead just make breakfast and dinner ahead of time by preparing my meals in advance.  (I tend to eat salads mostly, so this is really easy to do, and in the morning I'll also have a hardboiled egg).  Having these meals prepped in advance saves me two hours of time per day to not cook.  If I can spend more time on weekend to make my meals even tastier, I can get into this habit of cooking on the weekends and enjoying more time on weekdays.

Reading emails and prioritizing work day sounds okay on the surface, but that actually hurts our own plan for efficiency.  If every day is "random", and we have no sense of priority other than "what's urgent", then it becomes difficult to say which days will be long and which days will be short.  Many people in the corporate world love to say their job is "putting out the fires", and hold their head up high with pride.  I think these people are in the fast lane to dying of a stroke.   You'll notice these people tend to age faster too.  

**If you want to be a programmer, your job CANNOT be putting out fires.  Rather you need to think in advance how fires could occur, and PLAN for them appropriately.**

In my case, that's exactly what I am doing -- I usually look at emails coming in and analyze how often a problem happens over and over again.  If it's the same task -- aka, "update 20 websites to have these new pieces of content by day end", I'll think out a strategy to do that and pre-plan so if that task comes up again, I can get it done without much thought.  For example, with aforementioned task, I realized it kept coming to me every single week -- so I planned in advance by creating a simple CDN website (like a Dropbox), then whenever new content came in, I just uploaded it to the CDN and programmed the other 20 websites to pull in new content whenever the CDN changed.  BOOM! This stupid task alone used to take me 2-3 hours of my time (sometimes daily).  Now I have 2-3 hours daily instead to work on other things, such as higher level projects.

The great thing with higher level projects is that in the company's case, they are also trying to achieve optimization; perhaps save money or generate more revenue.  If high level projects get completed, I can add these to my resume and get even more pay if I market these accomplishments, as well as get promoted faster.  

Talking to boss, discussing projects, paying bills, driving -- all of these can be optimized too.  In the case of driving, I can just ask to work remote, which after COVID-19 I can definitely make a case for.  If my work is getting done and I'm easy to reach, my boss doesn't need to see me.  As for colleagues, I can still chat with them via Slack or if I really want to meet someone, I can do a Zoom meeting.  Efficient.   Paying bills can be easy if everything is pre-planned and I use features like auto-pay, and so long as I have money coming in -- if my money coming in always exceeds my money going out (through optimization), I'm in excellent shape.   These things don't need to take hours upon hours of time in my day to day.   (I can just check in on set times in the week instead).  

Ultimately, now I have whittled my day down to just doing high level projects, things I really can't escape from (e.g. brushing teeth), as well as things that are fun to do like exercise, play with kids, study, work on business, etc.  However, even in this space, I'm still striving for more ways to be efficient. And this is the space I'd love to be in, day after day after day.   So long as I can live a happy, easy life with lots of money coming in through optimizations I make, I'm great.

That's what I want for you too, so with this introduction -- you now have the core fundamentals and principles that I operate on.  Programming is just optimization.  You don't even need to learn any programming languages, I often think of programming as being the boss.  Sure, the languages out there can take time to learn, but at the core of every programming langauge, YOU are telling something else (a machine) to do work for you.  In the end, the language doesn't matter, what does matter is that you found a way to increase efficiency.   So with this core idea in your mind, let's get going to JavaScript, one of the best languages you can use to optimize your workload on the web.

## Homework

Think about your own life, what do you do daily (weekly/monthly)?  How could you optimize your own life tasks so you are better off?
