# Improving Our Resume With Design

Using the advice I gave you in the last section, I've put together a resume design.  That said, I know many of you are still beginners, so I am keeping my design basic enough to replicate for newbies, while giving those more design inclined the chance to do their own thing.  So if you are really good at design, go and make your resume look fantastic!  Just be sure you can code it too!  

If you want to use my basic design for now, you can and when you are ready to make your resume look even better (after this masterclass), feel free to really spruce it up.
