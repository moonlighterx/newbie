# Getting Started

For this course, you will need the following:

Tech requirements:
- Windows 10 or Mac OSX 10 (e.g. Catalina, Mojave) or Linux Ubuntu (18.0+)
- 8GB RAM / 256GB HD Computer 
- Mouse & Keyboard 
- Wifi / Lan Access

Personal requirements:
- Internet connection
- Time
- Patience 

If you've never used a computer before, you may want to spend time first learning how to use it.  Be sure you are familiar with how to create new files and folders, as well as how to use a browser like Google Chrome or Firefox to open and navigate to websites.   Be sure your computer is relatively fast, which is why I mentioned newer versions of Windows, Mac, Linux.  You can use older versions of any operating system if you want, but for newbies I recommend getting a computer that won't make you struggle to do simple things like typing and changing windows.  

My dad has a MacBook Pro from 2009, and while it still works, it definitely is SLOW.  Things like opening up a spreadsheet in Excel can take up to 5 minutes, while switching tabs on Chrome can sometimes crash or get stuck for up to a minute.   I've mentioned to him to trade in or buy a new computer, but he always says it would cost way too much.  I don't think this is the case anymore, as computers now cost under $500, and there are many "Open Box" deals you can find that make them even cheaper.  Still, if you prefer the computer you are using now because you are comfortable with it and don't care it's slow, you can work alongside this course. 

Also, don't attempt to work through this course on a cellphone or a tablet (Chromebooks/iPad Pros included).  Tablets are okay for viewing the courses, but cellphones and tablets don't support suitable software that can be used in the place of a computer.  I will often view courses on an iPad, but I'll regret it later that I didn't use my computer to practice out the code.  If you have a tablet with my course on the screen while you program on another computer, that's perfectly fine.  A cellphone might be too tiny to view code on, so I don't recommend it.

Finally, I put **time** and **patience** in the list above because you can't learn to code in a day.  Sorry to dash your dreams, but it's not possible.  

But that's great for you, because if everyone knew how to code, you'd have less career prospects right?  You need patience because coding is something that will probably consume the next six months to year of your life, given all the practice you'll need to keep up.  All that said, if you put in the hard work, it pays off.  So give yourself ample time and patience to be able to code, daily.  If you don't know how to do that, go back to the first lesson and optimize your life right now -- no skipping homework assignments! :)
